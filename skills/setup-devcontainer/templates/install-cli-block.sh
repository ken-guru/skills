# Mechanical install skeleton shared by every Tool Container flavor: fix the
# per-tool config volume's ownership (Docker creates a fresh named-volume
# mountpoint root:root regardless of the parent directory's ownership, even
# under /home/vscode), then run a curl-piped installer exactly once. Each
# tool's own post-create-block.sh calls these two functions and keeps only
# the rationale that's genuinely tool-specific (see there for it).
#
# install_cli checks by binary path, not `command -v` — this non-login
# script's PATH doesn't include ~/.local/bin, so a PATH-based check would
# miss an already-installed binary and re-run the network installer on every
# rebuild. A failed install is a warning, not a postCreateCommand-aborting
# error: every CLI installed this way is optional tooling and shouldn't
# block the rest of setup. Extra `VAR=val` arguments (Codex's
# CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1) are passed to the piped shell via `env`, not a
# `</dev/null` redirect or subshell wrapper, so they don't disturb the piped
# command's own stdin — see codex/post-create-block.sh for why that
# distinction matters.
