# Devcontainer setup

One shared devcontainer for this repo. Every AI CLI you add — Claude Code,
Codex, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot — installs into this same container via
its own independent skill (`setup-claude-devcontainer`,
`setup-codex-devcontainer`, `setup-antigravity-devcontainer`,
`setup-copilot-devcontainer`), run separately from this one, in any order,
as many times as you like.

- The container's own definition (`devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile`) is
  generated once by this skill and never changes when a CLI is added later —
  each CLI skill only ever adds its own install step to `post-create.sh` and,
  if opted into automatic skill sync, its own block to `post-start.sh`.
- Every CLI's config, auth, and history persists across rebuilds in one
  shared named volume (`{{REPO_NAME}}-config`, mounted at `/home/vscode`) —
  each CLI keeps its own subdirectory within it (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`,
  `~/.antigravity`, `~/.copilot`).
- `gh` CLI auth comes from a `GH_TOKEN` env var supplied via one shared,
  gitignored `.devcontainer/.env` file — see below.
- The workspace at `/workspace` is a live bind-mount of this repo's own
  working directory, not a clone — uncommitted or gitignored changes,
  including to `.devcontainer/` itself, are visible immediately.

## Opening the devcontainer

1. Install Docker Desktop and VS Code's **Dev Containers** extension
   (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`).
2. Copy `.devcontainer/.env.example` to `.devcontainer/.env` and paste in a
   GitHub token (a fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo). If you skip this,
   `initializeCommand` creates an empty `.env` for you so the build doesn't
   fail, but `gh` won't be authenticated until you fill in a real token and
   rebuild.
3. Open this repo in VS Code, then **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**
   (Cmd+Shift+P).
4. Run whichever CLI skill(s) you want (`setup-claude-devcontainer`, etc.) to
   add tools, then open a terminal and log in to each.

## Gotchas fixed here (and why)

**`remoteUser` must match the base image's actual non-root user.** The base
image's non-root user is `vscode`, not `node` — using the wrong home path
silently creates an unused directory owned by `root`, and nothing persists
because a tool never actually reads from or writes to the real user's
`$HOME`. Fix: `remoteUser: "vscode"` everywhere, matching the identity baked
into the image.

**A fresh named-volume mountpoint is always created `root:root`**, regardless
of the parent directory's ownership. Without a fix, a CLI's login or config
write fails to persist: the process (running as `vscode`) can't write into a
directory it doesn't own. Fix: each CLI's install block chowns its own config
subdirectory after the container starts.

## Troubleshooting

**`unable to find user vscode: no matching entries in passwd file` on
reopen.** Docker reused a container left over from an unrelated prior
devcontainer setup for this workspace folder instead of building fresh. The
Dev Containers CLI labels containers by
`devcontainer.local_folder=<workspace path>`, independent of what the
current config says, so a stale container survives even after its old
config was deleted or never committed — and the leftover container has no
`vscode` user because it wasn't built from this setup. Find and remove it,
then reopen:

```bash
docker ps -a --filter "label=devcontainer.local_folder=$(pwd)"
docker rm -f <container id>
```

## SSH deploy key and signing key automation

Not set up here. Agent-driven `git push` and signed commits need it — see
the
[setup-devcontainer skill](https://github.com/ken-guru/skills/tree/main/skills/setup-devcontainer)
(or ask the agent that built this to add it).
